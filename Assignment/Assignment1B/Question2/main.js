    Description: Write a function in JavaScript that will return the sum of the longest streak of consecutive numbers within an array. 
•	If there are no consecutive numbers in the array, the function will return zero.
•	If there are multiple instances of the same number of consecutive numbers in the array, the function will return the largest sum calculated between all instances.

•	Examples:
o	[1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 34, 2, 6] would return 6 (1+2+3)
o	[3, 2, 7, 5, 6, 7, 3, 8, 9, 10, 23, 2, 1, 2, 3] would return 27 (8+9+10)
o	[100, 101, 102, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9] would return 18 (3+4+5+6)
